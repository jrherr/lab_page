<h2 id="vectors-and-data-types">Vectors and Data Types</h2>

<pre><code class="(null)">### Vectors and data types</code></pre>


<p>A vector is the most common and basic data type in R, and is pretty much the workhorse of R. A vector is composed by a series of values, which can be either numbers or characters. We can assign a series of values to a vector using the <code>c()</code> function. For example we can create a vector of animal weights and assign it to a new object <code>weight_g</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">weight_g &lt;- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
weight_g</code></pre>


<p>A vector can also contain characters:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">animals &lt;- c(&quot;mouse&quot;, &quot;rat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;)
animals</code></pre>


<p>The quotes around &ldquo;mouse&rdquo;, &ldquo;rat&rdquo;, etc. are essential here. Without the quotes R will assume there are objects called <code>mouse</code>, <code>rat</code> and <code>dog</code>. As these objects don&rsquo;t exist in R&rsquo;s memory, there will be an error message.</p>

<p>There are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a vector. <code>length()</code> tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">length(weight_g)
length(animals)</code></pre>


<p>An important feature of a vector, is that all of the elements are the same type of data. The function <code>class()</code> indicates the class (the type of element) of an object:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">class(weight_g)
class(animals)</code></pre>


<p>The function <code>str()</code> provides an overview of the structure of an object and its elements. It is a useful function when working with large and complex objects:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">str(weight_g)
str(animals)</code></pre>


<p>You can use the <code>c()</code> function to add other elements to your vector:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">weight_g &lt;- c(weight_g, 90) # add to the end of the vector
weight_g &lt;- c(30, weight_g) # add to the beginning of the vector
weight_g</code></pre>


<p>In the first line, we take the original vector <code>weight_g</code>, add the value <code>90</code> to the end of it, and save the result back into <code>weight_g</code>. Then we add the value <code>30</code> to the beginning, again saving the result back into <code>weight_g</code>.</p>

<p>We can do this over and over again to grow a vector, or assemble a dataset. As we program, this may be useful to add results that we are collecting or calculating.</p>

<p>An <strong>atomic vector</strong> is the simplest R <strong>data type</strong> and is a linear vector of a single type. Above, we saw  2 of the 6 main <strong>atomic vector</strong> types  that R uses: <code>"character"</code> and <code>"numeric"</code> (or <code>"double"</code>). These are the basic building blocks that all R objects are built from. The other 4 <strong>atomic vector</strong> types are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>"logical"</code> for <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code> (the boolean data type)</li>
<li><code>"integer"</code> for integer numbers (e.g., <code>2L</code>, the <code>L</code> indicates to R that it&rsquo;s an integer)</li>
<li><code>"complex"</code> to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g., <code>1 + 4i</code>)</li>
<li><code>"raw"</code> for bitstreams</li>
</ul>


<p>You can check the type of your vector using the <code>typeof()</code> function and inputting your vector as the argument.</p>

<p>Vectors are one of the many <strong>data structures</strong> that R uses. Other important ones are lists (<code>list</code>), matrices (<code>matrix</code>), data frames (<code>data.frame</code>), factors (<code>factor</code>) and arrays (<code>array</code>).</p>

<h2 id="subsetting-vectors">Subsetting vectors</h2>

<p>If we want to extract one or several values from a vector, we must provide one or several indices in square brackets. For instance:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">animals &lt;- c(&quot;mouse&quot;, &quot;rat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;)
animals[2]
animals[c(3, 2)]</code></pre>


<p>We can also repeat the indices to create an object with more elements than the original one:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">more_animals &lt;- animals[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]
more_animals</code></pre>


<p>R indices start at 1. Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB, Julia, and R start counting at 1, because that&rsquo;s what human beings typically do. Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0 because that&rsquo;s simpler for computers to do.</p>

<h3 id="conditional-subsetting">Conditional subsetting</h3>

<p>Another common way of subsetting is by using a logical vector. <code>TRUE</code> will select the element with the same index, while <code>FALSE</code> will not:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">weight_g &lt;- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)
weight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)]</code></pre>


<p>Typically, these logical vectors are not typed by hand, but are the output of other functions or logical tests. For instance, if you wanted to select only the values above 50:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">weight_g &gt; 50    # will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet the condition
## so we can use this to select only the values above 50
weight_g[weight_g &gt; 50]</code></pre>


<p>You can combine multiple tests using <code>&amp;</code> (both conditions are true, AND) or <code>|</code> (at least one of the conditions is true, OR):</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">weight_g[weight_g &lt; 30 | weight_g &gt; 50]
weight_g[weight_g &gt;= 30 &amp; weight_g == 21]</code></pre>


<p>Here, <code>&lt;</code> stands for &ldquo;less than&rdquo;, <code>&gt;</code> for &ldquo;greater than&rdquo;, <code>&gt;=</code> for &ldquo;greater than or equal to&rdquo;, and <code>==</code> for &ldquo;equal to&rdquo;. The double equal sign <code>==</code> is a test for numerical equality between the left and right hand sides, and should not be confused with the single <code>=</code> sign, which performs variable assignment (similar to <code>&lt;-</code>).</p>

<p>A common task is to search for certain strings in a vector.  One could use the &ldquo;or&rdquo; operator <code>|</code> to test for equality to multiple values, but this can quickly become tedious. The function <code>%in%</code> allows you to test if any of the elements of a search vector are found:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">animals &lt;- c(&quot;mouse&quot;, &quot;rat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;)
animals[animals == &quot;cat&quot; | animals == &quot;rat&quot;] # returns both rat and cat
animals %in% c(&quot;rat&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;duck&quot;, &quot;goat&quot;)
animals[animals %in% c(&quot;rat&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;duck&quot;, &quot;goat&quot;)]</code></pre>


<h2 id="missing-data">Missing data</h2>

<p>As R was designed to analyze datasets, it includes the concept of missing data (which is uncommon in other programming languages). Missing data are represented in vectors as <code>NA</code>.</p>

<p>When doing operations on numbers, most functions will return <code>NA</code> if the data you are working with include missing values. This feature makes it harder to overlook the cases where you are dealing with missing data. You can add the argument <code>na.rm=TRUE</code> to calculate the result while ignoring the missing values.</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">heights &lt;- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights)
max(heights)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)</code></pre>


<p>If your data include missing values, you may want to become familiar with the functions <code>is.na()</code>, <code>na.omit()</code>, and <code>complete.cases()</code>. See below for examples.</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">## Extract those elements which are not missing values.
heights[!is.na(heights)]

## Returns the object with incomplete cases removed. The returned object is an atomic vector of type `&quot;numeric&quot;` (or `&quot;double&quot;`).
na.omit(heights)

## Extract those elements which are complete cases. The returned object is an atomic vector of type `&quot;numeric&quot;` (or `&quot;double&quot;`).
heights[complete.cases(heights)]</code></pre>


<p>Recall that you can use the <code>typeof()</code> function to find the type of your atomic vector.</p>

<h2 id="let-s-work-with-the-animal-survey-data">Let&rsquo;s work with the Animal Survey Data</h2>

<pre><code class="(null)">### Presentation of the survey data</code></pre>


<p>We are studying the species repartition and weight of animals caught in plots in our study area. The dataset is stored as a comma separated value (CSV) file.</p>

<p>Each row holds information for a single animal, and the columns represent:</p>

<p>We are going to use the R function <code>download.file()</code> to download the CSV file that contains the survey data from figshare, and we will use <code>read.csv()</code> to load into memory the content of the CSV file as an object of class <code>data.frame</code>.</p>

<p>To download the data into the <code>data/</code> subdirectory, run the following:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">download.file(&quot;https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169&quot;,
              &quot;data/portal_data_joined.csv&quot;)</code></pre>


<p>You are now ready to load the data:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">surveys &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/portal_data_joined.csv&quot;)</code></pre>


<p>This statement doesn&rsquo;t produce any output because, as you might recall, assignments don&rsquo;t display anything. If we want to check that our data has been loaded, we can print the variable&rsquo;s value: <code>surveys</code>.</p>

<p>Wow&hellip; that was a lot of output. At least it means the data loaded properly. Let&rsquo;s check the top (the first 6 lines) of this data frame using the function <code>head()</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">head(surveys)</code></pre>


<h2 id="what-are-data-frames-">What are data frames?</h2>

<p>Data frames are the <em>de facto</em> data structure for most tabular data, and what we use for statistics and plotting.</p>

<p>A data frame can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by the functions <code>read.csv()</code> or <code>read.table()</code>; in other words, when importing spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web).</p>

<p>A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because columns are vectors, they all contain the same class of data (e.g., characters, integers, factors). For example, here is a figure depicting a data frame comprising a numeric, a character, and a logical vector.</p>

<p>We can see this when inspecting the <b>str</b>ucture of a data frame with the function <code>str()</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">str(surveys)</code></pre>


<h2 id="inspecting--code-data.frame--code--objects">Inspecting <code>data.frame</code> Objects</h2>

<p>We already saw how the functions <code>head()</code> and <code>str()</code> can be useful to check the content and the structure of a data frame. Here is a non-exhaustive list of functions to get a sense of the content/structure of the data. Let&rsquo;s try them out!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Size:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>dim(surveys)</code> - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element,<br/>
    and the number of columns as the second element (the <strong>dim</strong>ensions of<br/>
    the object)</li>
<li><code>nrow(surveys)</code> - returns the number of rows</li>
<li><code>ncol(surveys)</code> - returns the number of columns</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Content:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>head(surveys)</code> - shows the first 6 rows</li>
<li><code>tail(surveys)</code> - shows the last 6 rows</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Names:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>names(surveys)</code> - returns the column names (synonym of <code>colnames()</code> for <code>data.frame</code><br/>
 objects)</li>
<li><code>rownames(surveys)</code> - returns the row names</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Summary:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>str(surveys)</code> - structure of the object and information about the class, length and<br/>
 content of  each column</li>
<li><code>summary(surveys)</code> - summary statistics for each column</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Object class:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>class(surveys)</code> -  information about the class of the object</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Note: most of these functions are &ldquo;generic&rdquo;, they can be used on other types of objects besides <code>data.frame</code>.</p>

<h2 id="indexing-and-subsetting-data-frames">Indexing and subsetting data frames</h2>

<pre><code class="(null)">## Indexing and subsetting data frames</code></pre>


<p>Our survey data frame has rows and columns (it has 2 dimensions), if we want to extract some specific data from it, we need to specify the &ldquo;coordinates&rdquo; we want from it. Row numbers come first, followed by column numbers. However, note that different ways of specifying these coordinates lead to results with different classes.</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">surveys[1, 1]   # first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[1, 6]   # first element in the 6th column (as a vector)
surveys[, 1]    # first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[1]      # first column of the data frame (as a data.frame)
surveys[1:3, 7] # first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)
surveys[3, ]    # the 3rd row of the data frame (as a data.frame)
head_surveys &lt;- surveys[1:6, ] # equivalent to head_surveys &lt;- head(surveys)</code></pre>


<p><code>:</code> is a special function that creates numeric vectors of integers in increasing or decreasing order, test <code>1:10</code> and <code>10:1</code> for instance.</p>

<p>You can also exclude certain indices of a data frame using the &ldquo;<code>-</code>&rdquo; sign:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">surveys[, -1]          # The whole data frame, except the first column
surveys[-c(7:34786), ] # Equivalent to head(surveys)</code></pre>


<p>Data frames can be subset by calling indices (as shown previously), but also by calling their column names directly:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">surveys[&quot;species_id&quot;]       # Result is a data.frame
surveys[, &quot;species_id&quot;]     # Result is a vector
surveys[[&quot;species_id&quot;]]     # Result is a vector
surveys$species_id          # Result is a vector</code></pre>


<p>In RStudio, you can use the autocompletion feature to get the full and correct names of the columns.</p>

<h2 id="factors">Factors</h2>

<pre><code class="(null)">### Factors</code></pre>


<p>When we did <code>str(surveys)</code> we saw that several of the columns consist of integers. The columns <code>genus</code>, <code>species</code>, <code>sex</code>, <code>plot_type</code>, &hellip; however, are of a special class called <code>factor</code>. Factors are very useful and actually contribute to making R particularly well suited to working with data. So we are going to spend a little time introducing them.</p>

<p>Factors represent categorical data. They are stored as integers associated with labels and they can be ordered or unordered. While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually integer vectors under the hood. So you need to be very careful when treating them as strings.</p>

<p>Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values, known as <em>levels</em>. By default, R always sorts <em>levels</em> in alphabetical order. For instance, if you have a factor with 2 levels:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">sex &lt;- factor(c(&quot;male&quot;, &quot;female&quot;, &quot;female&quot;, &quot;male&quot;))</code></pre>


<p>R will assign <code>1</code> to the level <code>"female"</code> and <code>2</code> to the level <code>"male"</code> (because <code>f</code> comes before <code>m</code>, even though the first element in this vector is <code>"male"</code>). You can see this by using the function <code>levels()</code> and you can find the number of levels using <code>nlevels()</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">levels(sex)
nlevels(sex)</code></pre>


<p>Sometimes, the order of the factors does not matter, other times you might want to specify the order because it is meaningful (e.g., &ldquo;low&rdquo;, &ldquo;medium&rdquo;, &ldquo;high&rdquo;), it improves your visualization, or it is required by a particular type of analysis. Here, one way to reorder our levels in the <code>sex</code> vector would be:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">sex # current order
sex &lt;- factor(sex, levels = c(&quot;male&quot;, &quot;female&quot;))
sex # after re-ordering</code></pre>


<p>In R&rsquo;s memory, these factors are represented by integers (1, 2, 3), but are more informative than integers because factors are self describing: <code>"female"</code>, <code>"male"</code> is more descriptive than <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>. Which one is &ldquo;male&rdquo;?  You wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell just from the integer data. Factors, on the other hand, have this information built in. It is particularly helpful when there are many levels (like the species names in our example dataset).</p>

<h3 id="converting-factors">Converting factors</h3>

<p>If you need to convert a factor to a character vector, you use <code>as.character(x)</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">as.character(sex)</code></pre>


<p>Converting factors where the levels appear as numbers (such as concentration levels, or years) to a numeric vector is a little trickier. The <code>as.numeric()</code> function returns the index values of the factor, not its levels, so it will result in an entirely new (and unwanted in this case) set of numbers. One method to avoid this is to convert factors to characters, and then to numbers. Another method is to use the <code>levels()</code> function. Compare:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">f &lt;- factor(c(1990, 1983, 1977, 1998, 1990))
as.numeric(f)               # Wrong! And there is no warning...
as.numeric(as.character(f)) # Works...
as.numeric(levels(f))[f]    # The recommended way.</code></pre>


<p>Notice that in the <code>levels()</code> approach, three important steps occur:</p>

<ul>
<li>We obtain all the factor levels using <code>levels(f)</code></li>
<li>We convert these levels to numeric values using <code>as.numeric(levels(f))</code></li>
<li>We then access these numeric values using the underlying integers of the vector <code>f</code> inside the square brackets</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="renaming-factors">Renaming factors</h3>

<p>When your data is stored as a factor, you can use the <code>plot()</code> function to get a quick glance at the number of observations represented by each factor level. Let&rsquo;s look at the number of males and females captured over the course of Athe experiment:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">## bar plot of the number of females and males captured during the experiment:
plot(surveys$sex)</code></pre>


<p>In addition to males and females, there are about 1700 individuals for which the sex information hasn&rsquo;t been recorded. Additionally, for these individuals, there is no label to indicate that the information is missing. Let&rsquo;s rename this label to something more meaningful. Before doing that, we&rsquo;re going to pull out the data on sex and work with that data, so we&rsquo;re not modifying the working copy of the data frame:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">sex &lt;- surveys$sex
head(sex)
levels(sex)
levels(sex)[1] &lt;- &quot;missing&quot;
levels(sex)
head(sex)</code></pre>


<h3 id="using--code-stringsasfactors---false--code-">Using <code>stringsAsFactors = FALSE</code></h3>

<p>By default, when building or importing a data frame, the columns that contain characters (i.e. text) are coerced (= converted) into factors. Depending on what you want to do with the data, you may want to keep these columns as <code>character</code>. To do so, <code>read.csv()</code> and <code>read.table()</code> have an argument called <code>stringsAsFactors</code> which can be set to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>

<p>In most cases, it is preferable to set <code>stringsAsFactors = FALSE</code> when importing data and to convert as a factor only the columns that require this data type.</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">## Compare the difference between our data read as `factor` vs `character`.
surveys &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/portal_data_joined.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
str(surveys)
surveys &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/portal_data_joined.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(surveys)
## Convert the column &quot;plot_type&quot; into a factor
surveys$plot_type &lt;- factor(surveys$plot_type)</code></pre>


<p>The automatic conversion of data type is sometimes a blessing, sometimes an annoyance. Be aware that it exists, learn the rules, and double check that data you import in R are of the correct type within your data frame. If not, use it to your advantage to detect mistakes that might have been introduced during data entry (a letter in a column that should only contain numbers for instance).</p>

<h2 id="formatting-dates">Formatting Dates</h2>

<p>One of the most common issues that new (and experienced!) R users have is converting date and time information into a variable that is appropriate and usable during analyses. As a reminder from earlier in this lesson, the best practice for dealing with date data is to ensure that each component of your date is stored as a separate variable. Using <code>str()</code>, We can confirm that our data frame has a separate column for day, month, and year, and that each contains integer values.</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">str(surveys)</code></pre>


<p>We are going to use the <code>ymd()</code> function from the package <strong><code>lubridate</code></strong>. <strong><code>lubridate</code></strong> belongs to the <strong><code>tidyverse</code></strong>-a package containing a group of packages that work well together. You can install <strong><code>lubridate</code></strong> directly (<code>install.packages("lubridate")</code>)) or by installing the <strong><code>tidyverse</code></strong> (<code>install.packages("tidyverse")</code>)). When you load  the <strong><code>tidyverse</code></strong> (<code>library(tidyverse)</code>), the core packages (the packages used in most data analyses) get loaded. <strong><code>lubridate</code></strong> however does not belong to the core tidyverse, so you have to load it explicitly with <code>library(lubridate)</code>.</p>

<p><code>ymd()</code> takes a vector representing year, month, and day and converts it to a POSIXct vector. POSIXct is a class of data recognized by R as being a date or a date and time. The argument that the function requires is flexible, but, as a best practice, is a character vector formatted as &ldquo;YYYY-MM-DD&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Start by loading the required package:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">library(lubridate)</code></pre>


<p>Let&rsquo;s create a date object and inspect the structure:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">my_date &lt;- ymd(&quot;2015-01-01&quot;)
str(my_date)</code></pre>


<p>Now let&rsquo;s paste the year, month, and day separately - we get the same result:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">my_date &lt;- ymd(paste(&quot;2015&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, sep = &quot;-&quot;)) # sep indicates the character to use to separate each component
str(my_date)</code></pre>


<p>Now we apply this function to the surveys dataset. Create a character vector from the <code>year</code>, <code>month</code>, and <code>day</code> columns of <code>surveys</code> using <code>paste()</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">paste(surveys$year, surveys$month, surveys$day, sep = &quot;-&quot;)</code></pre>


<p>This character vector can be used as the argument for <code>ymd()</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">ymd(paste(surveys$year, surveys$month, surveys$day, sep = &quot;-&quot;))</code></pre>


<p>The resulting POSIXct vector can be added to <code>surveys</code> as a new column called <code>date</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">surveys$date &lt;- ymd(paste(surveys$year, surveys$month, surveys$day, sep = &quot;-&quot;))
str(surveys) # notice the new column, with &apos;date&apos; as the class</code></pre>


<p>Let&rsquo;s make sure everything worked correctly. One way to inspect the new column is to use <code>summary()</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">summary(surveys$date)</code></pre>


<p>Something went wrong: some dates have missing values. Let&rsquo;s investigate where they are coming from.</p>

<p>We can use the functions we saw previously to deal with missing data to identify the rows in our data frame that are failing. If we combine them with what we learned about subsetting data frames earlier, we can extract the columns &ldquo;year, "month&rdquo;, &ldquo;day&rdquo; from the records that have <code>NA</code> in our new column <code>date</code>. We will also use <code>head()</code> so we don&rsquo;t clutter the output:</p>

<pre><code class="(null)">head(surveys[is.na(surveys$date),  c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;day&quot;)])</code></pre>


<p>In the square brackets, before the comma, we selected the rows that return <code>TRUE</code> when the values in the <code>date</code> column are missing. And after the comma, we selected the columns <code>year</code>, <code>month</code>, and <code>day</code>.</p>

<p>Why did these dates fail to parse? If you had to use these data for your analyses, how would you deal with this situation?</p>
